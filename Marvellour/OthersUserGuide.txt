--> The event code can be found in the task pane 
    (if the event is listed) else by searching the event.

Marking an event as done:-
Format:  md[event code]
--> The event code can be found beside the event on the 
    task pane.

    be found by searching for the event.
--> A task which is marked as done will not be displayed
    in the task pane.

--> Tasks in the archive will be considered for search queries. 
--> If you do not wish to store the task in the archive,
    you should permanently delete the event. 

Task archive:-
--> All events marked as done will be stored in the task archive.
--> The keyword “arch” displays all events in the archive.
--> Events in the archive will be considered for search queries. 

Notifications:-

    and which have not been marked as done will be displayed.
